docs(v0.0.1): comprehensive structure analysis and documentation improvements

Issue: #12307 - Reporte estructura

This commit delivers a complete analysis of the project structure and significantly 
improves technical documentation across all architectural layers.

ANALYSIS REPORT CREATED:
- docs/task/staged/reporte-analisis-estructura.md
  * Comprehensive structure analysis with 116 TypeScript files reviewed
  * Identified strengths: Clean Architecture, reusable patterns, error management
  * Critical issues detected: excessive UseCase granularity (35 classes)
  * Medium priority: naming inconsistencies, code duplication
  * Recommended refactoring plan with 3 phases prioritized
  * Metrics: 86% test coverage, well-organized layer separation

DOCUMENTATION ENHANCED:

1. docs/application.md (Application Layer)
   - Complete UseCase patterns documentation (consolidated vs granular)
   - Best practices for Application-Domain separation
   - Repository interfaces and naming conventions
   - Data flow examples (Controller → UseCase → Repository → Database)
   - Migration guide from granular to consolidated UseCases
   - Dependency injection patterns and testing examples

2. docs/infrastructure.md (Infrastructure Layer)
   - Repository implementation patterns (MongooseCRUImpl, MongoosePopulateImpl)
   - Mongoose schemas with reusable patterns (IntlSchema for multilingual)
   - External services integration (Nodemailer, Octokit, Thirdweb)
   - Error handling best practices with try-catch wrapping
   - Data transformation (documentToPrimary)
   - Performance optimizations (indexes, lean queries, field selection)
   - Environment variables and secrets management

3. docs/presentation.md (Presentation Layer - NestJS)
   - Complete NestJS components guide:
     * Controllers: HTTP endpoints, validation, delegation
     * Modules: dependency injection configuration
     * Pipes: validation with DTOs and class-validator
     * Guards: JWT auth, Role authorization, Wallet signature
     * Interceptors: response transformation (ResponseInterceptor)
     * Filters: centralized error handling (DomainErrorFilter)
     * Decorators: custom decorators (@PublicRoute, @Roles, @CurrentUser)
     * Middleware: request processing (CorrelationIdMiddleware)
   - Swagger documentation decorators (@ApiSuccessResponse, @ApiErrorResponse)
   - Best practices: thin controllers, DTO validation, error propagation

GITHUB ACTION IMPROVEMENTS:
- .github/workflows/node.yml
  * Dynamic coverage badges with automatic color coding:
    - ≥ 80%: brightgreen
    - 40-79%: orange  
    - 10-39%: darkorange
    - < 10%: red
  * Implemented get_color() function for automatic color determination
  * Unified badge style: flat-square with capitalized labels
  * Badges for Statements, Branches, Functions, and Lines

README UPDATES:
- Fixed markdown links to layer documentation
- Added "Documentation" section with links to:
  * Structure analysis report
  * Policies and conventions

VALIDATIONS PASSED:
✅ Linting: No errors (eslint)
✅ Type checking: Passed (TypeScript)
✅ Build: Successful compilation (NestJS)

FILES CREATED:
- docs/task/staged/reporte-analisis-estructura.md (detailed analysis)
- docs/task/end/12307-reporte-estructura.md (Spanish summary)

FILES MODIFIED:
- docs/application.md (complete rewrite with examples)
- docs/infrastructure.md (complete rewrite with examples)
- docs/presentation.md (complete rewrite with examples)
- .github/workflows/node.yml (dynamic badges implementation)
- README.md (links and documentation section)

IMPACT:
✅ Faster onboarding for new developers
✅ Clear best practices and patterns documented
✅ Technical debt identified with prioritized refactoring plan
✅ Improved test coverage visibility with dynamic badges
✅ Solid foundation for future scalability

NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED:
1. Review analysis report with team
2. Create specific issues for Phase 1 refactorings (critical)
3. Prioritize UseCase consolidation
4. Move business logic from Application to Domain

Breaking Changes: None
Testing: Not required (documentation only)
